<h2 style="text-align:center">Design Document - Recreation of Dr. John Snow Cholera Epidemic Map</h2> <br>
The goal of this project is to recreate Dr. John Snow’s cholera epidemic map ( London's 1854 cholera epidemic , the visualization created by Dr. John Snow was able to identify the source of the cholera epidemic outbreak) 
in an interactive way using d3, html, javascript and css.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Design process</u></b><br><br>
1)	Identified the use cases in the visualization, by going through the files (json, csv) shared.<br>
2)	Firstly, I came up with two sketches i.e., map and timeline chart. In the map, I could recognise two categories gender, age group that need to be represented. <br>

3) By using the timeline chart in the visualization, I was able to identify the count of deaths based on gender and age group. Based on the information identified additional sketches are drawn as below.<br>

<b><u>Design Choices</u></b> <br><br>

 1. The color encoding for age groups ( 0-10,  11-20,  21-40,  41-60, 61-80,  > 80) and gender(Male, Female) are selected keeping in mind colour blindness scenario and also they are contrasting colors, the legend on top of the map gives the information about the color encoding <cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_legend.html">[6]</a></cite>; so user can easily recognise the associated age group or gender.<br>
  
   2. Coming to the arrangements of the components of the visualization, the map and the timeline chart are two important components of the visualization, as both allow user to interact, so they are arranged on the top. <br>
   3. The default color encoding is based on age groups, the two buttons located on the top left gives the user the option to locate the location of deaths on the map based on age group and gender.<br>
   4. The line chart is used for representing timeline chart, the user can clearly identify a pattern of number of deaths on per day basis.  On hover of each data point, the user would be able to view the location of deaths on maps based on age group  <cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/phoebebright/3059392">[5]</a></cite> .<br>
   5. To view the percentages of total counts based on gender, age group; pie chart is used. The Pie chart is dynamic it changes the color and percentages based on button selection on top (i.e.  age group, gender). It's the reason for it’s placement just below the map.<br>
   6. Grouped bar chart <cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://embed.plnkr.co/plunk/rpRXFq">[1]</a></cite> is provided to get an overall view of the death counts in each of the age groups and gender. In a single view, user will be able to observe the number of deaths in each of the categories age groups, gender.<br>
   7. Tool tips are provided for map, timeline chart, pie chart, grouped bar chart to give additional information to the user <cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://codepen.io/billdwhite/pen/OJLeLR">[4]</a></cite>.<br>
   8. Zoom in/out and pan functionality is added to the map to view the death location on maps more clearly <cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://www.d3indepth.com/zoom-and-pan/">[2]</a></cite><cite style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://mtaptich.github.io/d3-lessons/d3-maps-live-code-2/">[3]</a></cite>. <br> <br>

<b><u>Facts </u></b><br><br>
Several questions are answered by the visualization:<br><br>
    1.From the map the location of the contaminated pump can be identified as near the BROAD STREET, that’s where there are the greatest number of deaths as per death locations.<br>
    2.From the timeline we get the information about deaths by date, the greatest number of deaths is on 1-Sep.<br>
    3.By looking at the grouped bar chart, we get counts based on age group and the counts of gender in age group. The most affected age groups are 0-10 (death count: 143 ) and > 80 (death count: 174) and both the genders (male – 284, female - 287) are almost equally affected.<br>
    4.Pie chart gives the over all percentages based on age groups [0-10 – (25.4%), >80 – (30.47%)] and gender (male-49.74%, female-50.26%).<br><br>
